# R Foundation Principles

![](images/R_logo.svg)

## R is Open

![](images/GNU.svg){.float-right}

* R is GNU
* R is open source
    + Source code is almost always available
    + Easy to audit

## R is collaborative

### Packages
Packages are collections of functions put together by other programmers for your use. (You can also publish packages.)

 * [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) stands for: Comprehensive  * [BioConductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/)
 * [GitHub](https://github.com/search/advanced)


## R is a Multi-Paradigm Programming Language

* Imperative & Declarative
* Functional & Object-oriented
* Procedural & Reflective
* Interpreted & Compiled.
* But above all **Data-centric*

## R is a Multi-Paradigm Programming Language

* **Imperative & Declarative**
* **Functional & Object-oriented**
* Procedural & Reflective
* Interpreted & Compiled.
* But above all **Data-centric*

## Imperative vs. Declarative

In **imperative** languages you tell the computer *how* you want something done.

In **declarative** languages you tell the compute *what* you want done.

>  "You can tell me what to do or how to do it but not both"

## Imperative Languages

> "How to do it"

### Examples

* [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)
* [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)
* [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)

### R
```{r "example of imperative language", purl=FALSE}
x <- 1:100
total = 0
for (i in x)
    total <- total + i
```

Your total is `r total`.

## Declarative Languages

> "What to do"

### Examples

* SQL
    + Give me a data set that contains everyone born in or after the year 2000.
* SAS
    + Perform a `PROC FREQ` to give me a count of birth years.

### R
```r
filter(data, dob >= "2000-01-01")
count(data, year(dob))
```

## Functional vs. Object

**Functional** paradigm centers around functions and connecting them together;
output from one is input to another.
Output depends only on the input, i.e. idempotent.

* May not **ever** change the inputs to a function.
* Minimize side effects and state changes.

**Object** oriented programming centers around objects and having objects
perform actions.

* Centers around state changes and side effects.
* An argument to a function often is changed by the function.

## Functional Languages

* Never changes the inputs
* you want something changed, explicitly say so

### Examples
* [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp)
* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

### R
```r
filter(iris, Species == "setosa")         #< Does nothing
iris <- filter(iris, Species == "setosa") #< Actually filters
```

## Object Oriented Programming

## Object Oriented Programming

So what?

## Why this maters if you are coming from SAS

* R is **VERY** different than SAS.
* You will have to step back from the Data step/Proc paradigm
* More procedures and structures less declarations.

## Why this maters if you are coming from STATA

* Data is an object in R
* There is no 'active' data set.

## Why this maters to everybody

* Knowing how a language is designed makes you more effective with it.

# How I teach R

## How I teach R

> * The way I use R
>   - Programmer time is most important.
>   - Simplest is very often the fastest computationaly as well
>   - Reuse of code.
> * Data focused
>   - results not details
> * Base R
>   - Because you need to know this to be effective.
> * Tidyverse
>   - Because this is better.

## In this class R is

* Functional,
* Imperative, and
* Declarative.
